People enter a line (queue) to get to the Ticket Counter in an organized manner.
The person to enter the queue first, will get the ticket first and leave the queue.
The person entering the queue next will get the ticket after the person in front of him
In this way, the person entering the queue last will the tickets last
Therefore, the First person to enter the queue gets the ticket
